# Terrarium
A Terraria poor clone. Mainly to understands some new techs and create some tools for future projects.

## How to install
If you are on Windows, just launch the .exe in the bin folder. You can move it with all the dependancies (DLL + data folder) if you want it to work.
Caution ! Some DLL might be missing for some systems, contact me so that I can add it to the project. You can also find the missing DLL on the web. If I didn't add it, maybe it's because it is a really common one.

If you are on Linux, just download the SFML packet and recompile the project ! (you may have to change the folder to search for SMFL)

SFML 2.0 required at least. The latest the best !
