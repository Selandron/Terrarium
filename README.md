# Terrarium
A Terraria poor clone. Mainly to understands some new techs and create some tools for future projects.

## HOW TO INSTALL
If you are on Windows, just launch the .exe in the bin folder. You can move it with all the dependancies (DLL + data folder) if you want it to work.
Caution ! Some DLL can be missing for some systems, contact me so that I can add it to the project. You can also find the missing DLL on the web. If I didn't add it, maybe it's because it is really common.

If you are on Linux, just download the SFML packet and recompile the project !
